I worked in a project as a part of my studies.It was developing a responsive webiste for a company,the biggest task for my group was with the backend 
developing ,we need to decide which database,server and framework we should need to complete the task
we used php+symfony+mysql .but my idea was JS+mongodb+EXPRESS
